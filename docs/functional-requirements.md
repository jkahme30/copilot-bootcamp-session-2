# Functional Requirements for TODO App

This document lists the core functional requirements for the TODO application. Each item includes a brief description and a simple acceptance criterion.

## 1. Create a Task
- Description: The user can create a new task with a title and optional fields.
- Optional fields: description, due date, priority, tags, subtasks, attachments.
- Acceptance: A new task appears in the task list after saving and contains the entered values.

## 2. Edit a Task
- Description: The user can edit any field of an existing task (title, description, due date, priority, tags, subtasks, attachments).
- Acceptance: Changes are persisted and reflected immediately in the UI.

## 3. Delete a Task
- Description: The user can delete a task. Deletion may be soft (archived) or permanent depending on settings.
- Acceptance: Deleted tasks are removed from the active task list (or moved to archive).

## 4. Mark Task Complete / Incomplete
- Description: The user can mark tasks as complete or revert them to incomplete.
- Acceptance: Task completion status is visible and can be filtered.

## 5. Due Date and Reminders
- Description: The user can set a due date and optionally a reminder/notification for a task.
- Acceptance: Due date is shown in the task view; reminder triggers a notification (when available).

## 6. Priority and Tags
- Description: The user can assign a priority (e.g., Low/Medium/High) and zero or more tags to a task.
- Acceptance: Priority and tags can be seen and used in sorting/filtering.

## 7. Sorting and Ordering
- Description: Tasks can be sorted by one or more criteria: due date, priority, creation date, manual order.
- Acceptance: Selected sort order is applied immediately and persists between sessions.

## 8. Filtering and Search
- Description: The user can filter tasks by status (active/completed), tags, priority, due date ranges, and search by text.
- Acceptance: Filters and search update the visible task list quickly.

## 9. Recurring Tasks
- Description: The user can create recurring tasks with configurable recurrence rules (daily/weekly/monthly/custom).
- Acceptance: Recurrences generate follow-up tasks according to the rule.

## 10. Subtasks / Checklists
- Description: The user can add subtasks or checklist items under a parent task and mark them complete independently.
- Acceptance: Parent task shows progress (e.g., 2/5 subtasks complete).

## 11. Persistence and Offline Support
- Description: Tasks persist across sessions. Optionally support offline mode with local caching and background sync.
- Acceptance: Tasks remain after closing and reopening the app; changes sync when online.

## 12. Import / Export
- Description: The user can import/export tasks (e.g., JSON, CSV) to migrate or backup data.
- Acceptance: Export produces a file with current tasks; import ingests valid files and adds tasks.

## 13. User Accounts and Multi-device Sync (Optional)
- Description: Support user accounts and sync tasks across devices when signed in.
- Acceptance: Signed-in users see the same tasks across devices.

## 14. Notifications and Reminders (Optional)
- Description: Provide push/OS notifications for reminders and due dates.
- Acceptance: Notifications are delivered per platform rules when enabled.

## 15. Validation and Error Handling
- Description: Validate required fields (e.g., task title) and surface clear error messages for failures.
- Acceptance: Invalid inputs are rejected with helpful messages; network errors show retry options.

## 16. Accessibility
- Description: The UI follows accessibility best practices (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, sufficient contrast).
- Acceptance: Core flows are operable via keyboard and labeled for screen readers.

## 17. Performance
- Description: The UI remains responsive with a large number of tasks (thousands). Use pagination or virtualized lists if needed.
- Acceptance: Core interactions complete within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., <150ms in typical conditions).

## Acceptance Criteria Summary
- CRUD operations for tasks work reliably.
- Sorting, filtering, and search are fast and persistent.
- Optional features (recurrence, reminders, sync) are clearly marked and can be implemented incrementally.

## Notes / Next Steps
- Decide which optional features are in scope for MVP (suggested: due dates, reminders, persistence, sync postponed).
- Define data model and API contracts for tasks and user accounts.
- Create UI wireframes for task list, task editor, and filters.
